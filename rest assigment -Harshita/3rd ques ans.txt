NO,We won't be able to pull the data from Database if we use different names for our data members.
It should be same as the colomn names of our table.
We can not use different names in the data member, as it throws an error "SQLSyntaxErrorException"


example:- I tried "itemname" instead of "name" in my sql table. 
	  output:
	  java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: Unknown column 'item0_.name' in 'field list'
